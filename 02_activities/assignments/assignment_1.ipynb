    "This solution works because it performs a traversal of the tree using **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**. BFS is particularly well-suited to problems where we need to explore all paths level by level, ensuring we capture all root-to-leaf paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BFS Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using a queue, we systematically explore all nodes **level by level**.\n",
    "- At each node, we append its value to the current path.\n",
    "- If the node is a **leaf node** (a node with no children), we record that path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "- The queue ensures that each node is processed in the correct order.\n",
    "- Each path is extended by one node at a time as we traverse the tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we might need to store all nodes in the queue if the tree is very unbalanced.\n",

    "1. **Recursive DFS**: Start at the root and traverse down the tree recursively, adding each node's value to the current path.\n",
    "2. **Base Case**: When we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), we add the current path to the result list.\n",
    "3. **Backtrack**: Once we reach a leaf or a dead-end, we backtrack by removing the last node from the current path and explore the other children.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
